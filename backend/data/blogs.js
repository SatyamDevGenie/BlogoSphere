  //     "GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on code projects. It uses the Git version control system to track changes to files, making it easy for multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously. GitHub provides tools for managing projects, reviewing code, and facilitating collaboration among developers. It's widely used in the software development community for open source and private projects alike.",

      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include things like understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, solving problems, and learning from experience. AI techniques range from traditional methods like rule-based systems to more advanced approaches such as machine learning and deep learning, where algorithms can automatically improve their performance through exposure to data.",

  //     "Software engineering is a discipline that involves applying engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It encompasses a range of activities, including requirements analysis, software design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Software engineers use various methodologies, tools, and programming languages to create high-quality software that meets user needs efficiently and reliably. The field of software engineering also emphasizes principles such as modularity, abstraction, reusability, and scalability to manage the complexity of software systems effectively.",

  //     "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of explicitly programming rules, machine learning algorithms learn patterns and relationships from data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. It involves the use of mathematical and statistical techniques to enable computers to improve their performance on a task as they are exposed to more data over time. Machine learning has various applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics.",
